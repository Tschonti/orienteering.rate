Welcome to my Final Project, Orienteering.rate! (https://rate-o.herokuapp.com/)

If you're not familiar with orienteering, I suggest you to take a quick look at it's Wikipedia page to understand what this is all about. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orienteering

The goal of this website is to give valuable feedback to the organisers of orienteering events.
On the main page, you see the list of events that are in the database. Even without logging in you can see which events have the highest ratings.
You can also filter the events based on country and classification, and also the users that have rated the events.
If you for example filter the ratings for Youth (-18), the average rating in the table will be the average rating of users that have registered as a Youth.
But if you want to try the other features of the website, you need an account. You'll need an active email adress to sign up, since you won't have full access unless you've confirmed you email.
Once you've created an account and logged in, you'll be able to rate events that others have created, and even add a comment to explain your rating.
A rating consits of 4 sub-ratings: overall rating and 3 of the most important factors at an orienteering event.
Comments under events can also be rated, similiar to Reddit (upvote, downvote).
Ideally the community will downvote the inappropriate comments and upvote the ones with genuine feedback.
What's more, you can also create events that other people can rate. This way the website could be used around the world without admins uploading each event.
You're always allowed to delete events that you've created or remove ratings (including the comment). You can also delete your account, which will also delete all your events and ratings.
The website also has a Javascript validation on every form you submit, preventing you from inserting faulty data to the database.
Finally, it uses Liveresult's API to import events and their result into its database. 
If you look at the event page of an event that has been imported, you'll be able to see the results of each class.
